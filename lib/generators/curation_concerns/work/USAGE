Description:
  This generator creates the necessary files for work that extends
  CurationConcerns's GenericWork.

Example:
  rails generate curation_concerns:work ScholarlyPaper

  This will create:
    app/repository_models/scholarly_paper.rb
    app/actors/curation_concern/scholarly_paper_actor.rb
    app/controllers/curation_concern/scholarly_papers_controller.rb
    app/views/curation_concern/scholarly_papers/.keep
    spec/factories/scholarly_paper_factory.rb
    spec/repository_models/scholarly_paper_spec.rb
    spec/actors/curation_concern/scholarly_paper_actor_spec.rb
    spec/controllers/curation_concern/scholarly_papers_controller_spec.rb

  This will also:
    register ScholarlyPaper as a valid curation concern
